    "Alameda County in California has many diverse communities with a number of variables that can effect eduction outcomes. In this analysis we will look at the effect proximity in food sources such as grocery stores and restaurants have on test scores in math. We will answer the question: Does food proximity in a community effect math test scores in schools? We will find patterns from the results and make suggestions on where to place new grocery stores in low performing communities. \n",
